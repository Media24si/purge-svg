## What is PurgeSVG

If you're using external SVG sprites for your icon system there is a good chance to have a lot of unused icons.

PurgeSVG will analyze your content and will remove all unused icons. This will make your SVG file a lot smaller.

It also enables you to merge more SVG file into one and reducing network requests.

Be aware that external SVG sprites are not supported in any version of IE. If you need support for IE check out [svg4everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody).

This package was inspired (and some code copied) from [Purgecss](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss)
